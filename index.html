            <h2>"Jaffna Afternoons: Ondaatje's Storytelling"</h2>
            <p>
              In this chapter, Ondaatje conveys to the reader how the
              storytelling of the book will be expressed. With his writing style
              and way of storytelling being influenced from his family's
              discussions and way of recalling family memories that is not
              necessarily in chronological order.
              <a href="#quote3">
                "No story is ever told just once. Whether a memory of funny
                hideous scandal, we will return to it an hour later and retell
                the story with additions and this time a few judgements thrown
                in." (p. 8).
              </a>
              The writing and discussion throughout the chapter expresses his
              writing style throughout the rest of the story. Telling the
              stories and faint memories in sections, which are not in
              chronological order, only connecting and making sense of the chaos
              by self-referencing the different memories throughout. The
              conversation explains the reasoning behind the writing style,
              deepening the reader understanding of why Ondaatje chose this
              specific style for his family memoir, being that his family often
              recalls memories in the same manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              One aspect of Ondaatje's style of writing and storytelling in the
              book is constant self-references to the memoir itself. There are
              many instances of self-references in this chapter; when Michael is
              describing the house they are in when visiting Ceylon, from
              <a href="#quote1">
                "The walls, painted in recent years a warm rose-red." (p. 6).</a
              >
              And,
              <a href="#quote2"
                >"The doors are twenty feet high, as if awaiting the day when a
                family of acrobats will walk from room to room, sideways ... "
                (p. 6).</a
              >
              Which is referenced later towards the end of the chapter.
              <a href="#quote5"
                >"We are approaching the door being twenty feet high ... The
                whole family walks slowly through the pale pink rose-coloured
                walls into the next room." (p. 9).</a
              >
              The repeated use of self-references in the chapter both
              foreshadows and also reveals to readers the writing style of
              Ondaatje. These references are used to convey the writing and
              storytelling method of which the memoir is based off of, prompting
              the reader to focus on small details, as many references are
              important in later sections of the novel.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, these examples in Jaffna Afternoons only explore the
              self-referencing aspect of Ondaatje's writing in the memoir. The
              other aspect of the references being in non-chronological order is
              explored earlier, in the first chapter. A very early example we
              see of this is when Michael is asked during his farewell party,
              <a href="#quote0"
                >"'So how did your grandmother die?' 'Natural causes.' 'What?'
                'Floods.'" (p. 5).</a
              >
              The reference is about Lalla, who dies during a particularly
              strong monsoon which causes a flood as the reader learns in a
              later section.
              <a href="#quote111"
                >"Below the main street of Nuwara Eliya teh land drops suddenly
                and Lala fell into deeper waters ... there was the great blue
                ahead of her ... she hit it and was dead." (p. 111).</a
              >
              The effect created is a sense of curiosity for the reader when
              first being presented with small details of memories. Then when
              finally being told a larger portion of the story, the reader is
              able to recollect and reflect on the story as a whole after
              linking many of the memories told as a singular entity. The
              storytelling style creating a reading experience that requires
              more focus to recall previous events that were intentionally just
              briefly mentioned, which develops reader understanding of the
              events that occur as later sections of the memoir are revealed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This use of disconnected storytelling of individual stories and
              self-references to connect the memoir can also have flaws. One of
              which, being difficult to follow and requiring very focused
              reading and analysis in order to even understand the events of the
              memoir at a basic level. This style of writing often leads to
              confusing references throughout the novel. Some of these
              references seemingly leading to nowhere, creating many red
              herrings. One particularly example of this in Jaffna Afternoons
              being,
              <a href="#quote4"
                >"I do catch one piece of dialogue. A Mr. Hobday has asked my
                father if he has any Dutch antiques in the house. And he
                replies, 'Well ... there is my mother.'" (p. 9).</a
              >
              A certain Mr. Hobday talking to Michael's father is the one and
              only piece of dialogue he manages to catch. The character can be
              assumed to be important, talking to Michael's father, who is one
              of the central focuses of the memoir. The particular storytelling
              style could be used to reference this moment later in the memoir,
              however, the memoir seems to never mentions Hobday again after
              this chapter. This creates a creates some confusion, as other
              references, just as brief as this one, are very important to the
              story.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jaffna Afternoons encapsulates Ondaatje's writing style, with main
              aspects being self-references to connect together a memoir told as
              individual stories, which are often not in chronological order.
              The chapter uses many references within itself, to deliberately
              show the the storytelling method in a short chapter, making it
              clear how the story will be presented. This storytelling and
              writing style, creating an effect of curiosity and makes the
              reader have to focus on every small detail and brief mention of
              stories. However, the writing style also creates some red herrings
              throughout the story, that lead stories that may be made up, or
              not important enough to be explored in the story. The chapter
              itself, serves as a preface to the story, telling the reader how
              the memoir is structured not by time, but instead by connections
              of references, and tells the reader how they should read the
              memoir.

            <h2>Aunts: Threads into Stories, Truth and Fiction</h2>

            <p>
              Ondaatje starts the chapter with a short passage about his aunts,
              and how he has relied on them to make sense of his family history.
              <a href="#quotel2"
                >"How I have used them... They knit the story together, each
                memory a wild thread in the sarong." (p. 92).</a
              >
              The passage using symbolism to support the central metaphor of
              knitting as connecting memory into story. With threads serving as
              a symbol for memories, and also the sarong, a garment which is
              sometimes worn by men in various places around the world,
              including Ceylon. The sarong is used as a symbol for Michael's
              family history in Ceylon and the stories that are used to build
              it. The central metaphor of knitting, connecting threads of
              memories into a sarong, a complete story. The use of this metaphor
              creates emphasis on the message of the passage; how Ondaatje takes
              inspiration from his aunts, knitting together the threads, as
              Michael also does throughout the memoir. With chapters often
              serving as memories, often disconnected but still connected by
              sections that represent complete stories, and references to
              connect sections into a memoir.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another way Ondaatje develops the understanding of relationship
              between Michael and his aunt Dolly is through the passage,
              <a href="#quotel4"
                >"It has moved tangible palpable, into her brain, the way memory
                invades the present in those who are old, the way gardens invade
                houses here." (p. 94).</a
              >
              Michael describes how his aunt describes and tells stories in such
              a way that makes distant or non-existent memories for Michael seem
              more real, as if he were there to witness the events. The passage
              also speaks on older generations being able to pass down their
              memories and stories, in this case, to Michael. The use of this
              passage is to develop the theme, that stories are passed down from
              generations and one should seek out their history, just as Michael
              has done.
            </p>

            <p>
              When trying to capture memories that Michael himself has not
              experiences and witnessed, he comes across some challenges. In the
              previous chapter, Michael expresses his confusion when trying to
              piece together stories he is told in a linear, chronological
              order. The same confusion the reader would also have if given the
              memories in such order without connections between them.
              <a href="#quotel0"
                >"Wait a minute, wait a minute! When did all this happen, I'm
                trying to get it straight ... Wait a minute, wait a minute, when
                is this happening?" (pp. 87-89).</a
              >
              In which, Michael expresses confusion, lost in the wild threads of
              memories. The question from Michael can be related to by the
              reader, and conveys to the reader, that they should not be trying
              to think of the memories linearly, as Michael has fail to do so in
              this moment. The rest of the passage continued also conveys the
              same idea and thoughts of Michael, being purposefully confusing
              and hard to follow,
            </p>

            <a href="#quotel1">
              <p>
                "Anyway ... there seems to be three different stories that
                you're telling.
              </p>

              <p>No, one, everybody says laughing.</p>

              <p>
                One when your mother was nine. Then when she was sixty-five and
                drinking at the wedding lunch, and obviously there is a period
                of unrequited love suffered by the silent Trevor who never
                stated his love ... when she was sixty-five." (p. 90).
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>
              Michael's relatives laughing when he is confused about the story
              being told knowing that the disconnected memories are hard to
              follow. The effect created from this passage further emphasizing
              Michael's confusion due to the mixture of memories being told to
              him.
            </p>

            <p>
              Towards the end of Aunts, Michael reveals to the reader, that some
              elements of memories and stories in the memoir may be tampered
              with or manipulated with.
              <a href="#quotel3"
                >"The frailty does not stop her stories though she pauses now
                and then to say, 'God if you quote me I'm dead. I'll be caught
                for libel and killed.'" (p. 93).</a
              >
              Libel, being lies and gossip she and all of their relatives like
              to discuss about as if they were fact. Michael, of course not
              being able to witness all the stories in the memoir, tells the
              stories he is told from relatives, which here is a mix of truth
              and lies. With the context of Ondaatje using the storytelling
              style of his aunts, the reader is left to assume the same about
              the mix of fact and fiction. This is seen all throughout the
              novel, though the reader can never be sure of how false any event
              is. One instance, when Michael is talking to the Prime Minister of
              Sri Lanka about Mervyn,
              <a href="#quotel6"
                >"Hell of a lot of trouble that one caused. You know he jumped
                out of the train when it was going full speed … luckily we were
                passing a paddy field and he fell into it. When the train
                stopped he just climbed aboard again covered with mud." (p.
                138).</a
              >
              The story seems way too unreal to be an authentic story, but the
              use of faction makes the reader question its legitimacy. This use
              of faction in the memoir, that blurs the line between true events
              and fiction, makes the reader doubt some elements of ridiculous
              stories that seem fictitious, is present throughout the novel.
            </p>

            <p>
              Aunts, is a chapter that is very significant to the entire novel,
              with its main purpose to develop the reader's perception of how
              Michael presents the stories of the memoir. It conveys how Michael
              gets the stories for the memoir, how the memories are always a mix
              of truth and fiction, and why he tells the stories not in
              chronological order. These methods of storytelling are displayed
              throughout the story, so is very significant that the reader can
              understand why Ondaatje uses such methods.
