            <h2>"Jaffna Afternoons: Ondaatje's Storytelling"</h2>
            <p>
              In this chapter, Ondaatje conveys to the reader how the
              storytelling of the book will be expressed. With his writing style
              and way of storytelling being influenced from his family's
              discussions and way of recalling family memories that is not
              necessarily in chronological order.
              <a href="#quote3">
                "No story is ever told just once. Whether a memory of funny
                hideous scandal, we will return to it an hour later and retell
                the story with additions and this time a few judgements thrown
                in." (p. 8).
              </a>
              The writing and discussion throughout the chapter expresses his
              writing style throughout the rest of the story. Telling the
              stories and faint memories in sections, which are not in
              chronological order, only connecting and making sense of the chaos
              by self-referencing the different memories throughout. The
              conversation explains the reasoning behind the writing style,
              deepening the reader understanding of why Ondaatje chose this
              specific style for his family memoir, being that his family often
              recalls memories in the same manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              One aspect of Ondaatje's style of writing and storytelling in the
              book is constant self-references to the memoir itself. There are
              many instances of self-references in this chapter; when Michael is
              describing the house they are in when visiting Ceylon, from
              <a href="#quote1">
                "The walls, painted in recent years a warm rose-red." (p. 6).</a
              >
              And,
              <a href="#quote2"
                >"The doors are twenty feet high, as if awaiting the day when a
                family of acrobats will walk from room to room, sideways ... "
                (p. 6).</a
              >
              Which is referenced later towards the end of the chapter.
              <a href="#quote5"
                >"We are approaching the door being twenty feet high ... The
                whole family walks slowly through the pale pink rose-coloured
                walls into the next room." (p. 9).</a
              >
              The repeated use of self-references in the chapter both
              foreshadows and also reveals to readers the writing style of
              Ondaatje. These references are used to convey the writing and
              storytelling method of which the memoir is based off of, prompting
              the reader to focus on small details, as many references are
              important in later sections of the novel.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, these examples in Jaffna Afternoons only explore the
              self-referencing aspect of Ondaatje's writing in the memoir. The
              other aspect of the references being in non-chronological order is
              explored earlier, in the first chapter. A very early example we
              see of this is when Michael is asked during his farewell party,
              <a href="#quote0"
                >"'So how did your grandmother die?' 'Natural causes.' 'What?'
                'Floods.'" (p. 5).</a
              >
              The reference is about Lalla, who dies during a particularly
              strong monsoon which causes a flood as the reader learns in a
              later section.
              <a href="#quote111"
                >"Below the main street of Nuwara Eliya teh land drops suddenly
                and Lala fell into deeper waters ... there was the great blue
                ahead of her ... she hit it and was dead." (p. 111).</a
              >
              The effect created is a sense of curiosity for the reader when
              first being presented with small details of memories. Then when
              finally being told a larger portion of the story, the reader is
              able to recollect and reflect on the story as a whole after
              linking many of the memories told as a singular entity. The
              storytelling style creating a reading experience that requires
              more focus to recall previous events that were intentionally just
              briefly mentioned, which develops reader understanding of the
              events that occur as later sections of the memoir are revealed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This use of disconnected storytelling of individual stories and
              self-references to connect the memoir can also have flaws. One of
              which, being difficult to follow and requiring very focused
              reading and analysis in order to even understand the events of the
              memoir at a basic level. This style of writing often leads to
              confusing references throughout the novel. Some of these
              references seemingly leading to nowhere, creating many red
              herrings. One particularly example of this in Jaffna Afternoons
              being,
              <a href="#quote4"
                >"I do catch one piece of dialogue. A Mr. Hobday has asked my
                father if he has any Dutch antiques in the house. And he
                replies, 'Well ... there is my mother.'" (p. 9).</a
              >
              A certain Mr. Hobday talking to Michael's father is the one and
              only piece of dialogue he manages to catch. The character can be
              assumed to be important, talking to Michael's father, who is one
              of the central focuses of the memoir. The particular storytelling
              style could be used to reference this moment later in the memoir,
              however, the memoir seems to never mentions Hobday again after
              this chapter. This creates a creates some confusion, as other
              references, just as brief as this one, are very important to the
              story.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jaffna Afternoons encapsulates Ondaatje's writing style, with main
              aspects being self-references to connect together a memoir told as
              individual stories, which are often not in chronological order.
              The chapter uses many references within itself, to deliberately
              show the the storytelling method in a short chapter, making it
              clear how the story will be presented. This storytelling and
              writing style, creating an effect of curiosity and makes the
              reader have to focus on every small detail and brief mention of
              stories. However, the writing style also creates some red herrings
              throughout the story, that lead stories that may be made up, or
              not important enough to be explored in the story. The chapter
              itself, serves as a preface to the story, telling the reader how
              the memoir is structured not by time, but instead by connections
              of references, and tells the reader how they should read the
              memoir.

            <h2>Final Days Father Tongue: Warm and Cold</h2>
            <p>
              ### Jennifer Jennifer, Mervyn's daughter from his second marriage:
              "He brought me up like a princess and would defend me against
              everyone, even my strictest teachers. There was a Miss Kaula - a
              battleaxe." (p. 176). The passage uses the term battleaxe to
              describe one of Jennifer's teachers, whom was strict and Mervyn
              had to protect his daughter against. Often referring to a violent
              weapon, battleaxe is used as symbolism, in this context just means
              to be negative and overly harsh. Emphasizes how Mervyn was a good
              person in many aspects, one of which being a good father that
              treated his children kindly and was protective over them. The
              passage, along with others in the chapter, provides the readers
              more character depth and understanding of Mervyn, he is seen as
              not just an alcoholic that makes irrational decisions due to his
              addiction, but as a father that cares about his children. ### V.C.
              De Silva V.C. De Silva, one of Mervyn's closest friends: "I
              learned a great deal from him. There was nothing about poultry he
              didn't know. Or dogs. He used to have a lot of faith in me so I
              loved him too." The passage here includes many memories of Mervyn,
              and V.C. talks about him with a positive and warm tone. He recalls
              very positive memories as well, recalling how Mervyn has helped
              him in his life. Most significantly, the warm tone in the passage
              emphasizes to the reader how Mervyn has positively affected many
              of the people around him. ### Archer Jayawardene Archer
              Jayawardene, one of Mervyn's closest friends: "A year before he
              died he went into that terrible depression. V.C de Silva and I
              would go there and he wouldn't speak to us. We were his closest
              friends and he ignored us." (p. 179). In this passage, Archer
              speaks on how during Mervyn's depression, he would often ignore
              his closest friends. Interestingly, many remarks from this passage
              seem cold, almost distant from Mervyn. The passage contrasts with
              previous ones, where memories of Mervyn were spoken about in a
              more positive tone. The contrast here is used to imply that
              everything Michael is told about his father before might have some
              truth, but also some details not entirely truthful. ### Michael
              Ondaatje Michael Ondaatje, Mervyn's son: "He would swing wildly,
              in those last years - not so much from sobriety to drink, but from
              calmness to depression." (p. 180). Along with the other entries,
              the passage is used to highlight the main significance of this
              chapter, which is to bring more more understanding about Mervyn,
              and also how Michael's own understanding of his father changes. He
              is not just told crazy stories about his father's train rides, but
              also positive stories about him. The theme conveyed here is that
              people are not one-sided, just good or bad, and those that
              struggle with many issues and addiction can still have positive
              moments in their life.

            <h2>"Last Morning: Ondaatje, Past and Present"</h2>
            <p>
              Last Morning, the short chapter that concludes Ondaatje's memoir
              recounts waking up on the last morning of his trip back to Ceylon.
              There are many interesting literary features that Michael uses
              when describing the morning, "Half an hour before light I am woken
              by the sound of rain. Rain on wall, coconut, and petal." (p. 184).
              The narration describing the sound of rain on various objects
              creates the imagery of the streets of Ceylon; still dark out,
              trees with tropical leaves, a coconut on the ground, rain
              splashing on the roads and the tropical landscape around it. The
              imagery created highlights Michael's thoughts, and places the
              reader into the mind of Michael, as if they were there with him in
              that room on the last dark morning in Ceylon. The reader can
              relate to Michael, having the picture created by the imagery in
              their minds. The imagery continues into the chapter, "When I turn
              on the light, the bulb on the long three-foot cord will sway to
              the electrical breeze making my shadow move back and forth on the
              wall" (p. 184). The narration does not describe what Michael sees,
              but creates an image in his head of what he knows he will see.
              This is another piece of imagery that is to emphasize the
              connection between the narrator and the reader, make the reader
              relate more to Michael.
            </p>

            <p>
              Towards the end of this last chapter, the reader gets to
              understand Michaels thoughts after the memoir, a sense of
              fulfillment, finally remembering all the memories from childhood
              that were previously lost. From just being able to remember
              fragments of memories, to end of his trip back to Ceylon, being
              able to reflect on the present and his childhood,
            </p>
            <p>
              "There is nothing in this view that could not be a hundred years
              old, that might not have been here when I left Ceylon at the age
              of eleven. My mother looks out of her Colombo window thinking of
              divorce, my father wakes after three days of alcohol, his body
              hardly able to move from the stiffness in muscles he cannot
              remember exerting ... all this was here before I dreamed of
              getting married, having children, wanting to write" (p. 185).
            </p>
            <p>
              The passage has significance to the whole novel, with the context
              of a novel of Michael himself exploring his own family history,
              learning about the family members in Ceylon he never got to meet,
              and re-connecting with his childhood. It is used to contrast with
              Michael's thoughts at the beginning of the memoir, when Michael
              felt distant from those his relatives and Ceylon. The contrast
              created brings the reader to the start of the novel, "I realized I
              would be travelling back to the family I had grown from - those
              relations from my parents' generation who stood in my memory like
              frozen opera." (p. 4). The passage uses frozen opera as a metaphor
              to describe his relations with his family back in Ceylon, frozen
              in time, like distant memories. Ondaatje deliberately includes
              this assertion at the start of the novel to contrast his thoughts
              after his trip. The contrast between the start and end of the
              memoir to emphasize the reader's connection with Michael and his
              feelings towards finding past memories.

            <h2>"Aunts: Threads into Stories, Truth and Fiction"</h2>

            <p>
              Ondaatje starts the chapter with a short passage about his aunts,
              and how he has relied on them to make sense of his family history.
              <a href="#quotel2"
                >"How I have used them... They knit the story together, each
                memory a wild thread in the sarong." (p. 92).</a
              >
              The passage using symbolism to support the central metaphor of
              knitting as connecting memory into story. With threads serving as
              a symbol for memories, and also the sarong as a complete story.
              The sarong is used as a symbol for Michael's family history in
              Ceylon and the stories that are used to build it. The central
              metaphor of knitting, connecting threads of memories into a
              sarong, a complete story. The use of this metaphor creates
              emphasis on the message of the passage; how Ondaatje takes
              inspiration from his aunts, knitting together the threads, as
              Michael also does throughout the memoir. With chapters often
              serving as memories, often disconnected but still connected by
              sections that represent complete stories, and references to
              connect sections into a memoir.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another way Ondaatje develops the understanding of relationship
              between Michael and his aunt Dolly is through the passage,
              <a href="#quotel4"
                >"It has moved tangible palpable, into her brain, the way memory
                invades the present in those who are old, the way gardens invade
                houses here." (p. 94).</a
              >
              Michael describes how his aunt describes and tells stories in such
              a way that makes distant or non-existent memories for Michael seem
              more real, as if he were there to witness the events. The passage
              also speaks on older generations being able to pass down their
              memories and stories, in this case, to Michael. The use of this
              passage is to develop the theme, that stories are passed down from
              generations and one should seek out their history, just as Michael
              has done.
            </p>

            <p>
              When trying to capture memories that Michael himself has not
              experiences and witnessed, he comes across some challenges. In the
              previous chapter, Michael expresses his confusion when trying to
              piece together stories he is told in a linear, chronological
              order. The same confusion the reader would also have if given the
              memories in such order without connections between them.
              <a href="#quotel0"
                >"Wait a minute, wait a minute! When did all this happen, I'm
                trying to get it straight ... Wait a minute, wait a minute, when
                is this happening?" (pp. 87-89).</a
              >
              In which, Michael expresses confusion, lost in the wild threads of
              memories. The question from Michael can be related to by the
              reader, and conveys to the reader, that they should not be trying
              to think of the memories linearly, as Michael has fail to do so in
              this moment. The rest of the passage continued also conveys the
              same idea and thoughts of Michael, being purposefully confusing
              and hard to follow,
            </p>

            <a href="#quotel1">
              <p>
                "Anyway ... there seems to be three different stories that
                you're telling.
              </p>

              <p>No, one, everybody says laughing.</p>

              <p>
                One when your mother was nine. Then when she was sixty-five and
                drinking at the wedding lunch, and obviously there is a period
                of unrequited love suffered by the silent Trevor who never
                stated his love ... when she was sixty-five." (p. 90).
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>
              Michael's relatives laughing when he is confused about the story
              being told knowing that the disconnected memories are hard to
              follow. The effect created from this passage further emphasizing
              Michael's confusion due to the mixture of memories being told to
              him.
            </p>

            <p>
              Towards the end of Aunts, Michael reveals to the reader, that some
              elements of memories and stories in the memoir may be tampered
              with or manipulated with.
              <a href="#quotel3"
                >"The frailty does not stop her stories though she pauses now
                and then to say, 'God if you quote me I'm dead. I'll be caught
                for libel and killed.'" (p. 93).</a
              >
              Libel, being lies and gossip she and all of their relatives like
              to discuss about as if they were fact. Michael, of course not
              being able to witness all the stories in the memoir, tells the
              stories he is told from relatives, which here is a mix of truth
              and lies. With the context of Ondaatje using the storytelling
              style of his aunts, the reader is left to assume the same about
              the mix of fact and fiction. This is seen all throughout the
              novel, though the reader can never be sure of how false any event
              is. One instance, when Michael is talking to the Prime Minister of
              Sri Lanka about Mervyn,
              <a href="#quotel6"
                >"Hell of a lot of trouble that one caused. You know he jumped
                out of the train when it was going full speed … luckily we were
                passing a paddy field and he fell into it. When the train
                stopped he just climbed aboard again covered with mud." (p.
                138).</a
              >
              The story seems way too unreal to be an authentic story, but the
              use of faction makes the reader question its legitimacy. This use
              of faction in the memoir, that blurs the line between true events
              and fiction, makes the reader doubt some elements of ridiculous
              stories that seem fictitious, is present throughout the novel.
            </p>

            <p>
              Aunts, is a chapter that is very significant to the entire novel,
              with its main purpose to develop the reader's perception of how
              Michael presents the stories of the memoir. It conveys how Michael
              gets the stories for the memoir, how the memories are always a mix
              of truth and fiction, and why he tells the stories not in
              chronological order. These methods of storytelling are displayed
              throughout the story, so is very significant that the reader can
              understand why Ondaatje uses such methods.

            <h2>Sweet like a Crow</h2>
            <p>
              Sweet like a crow is a poem written by Ondaatje, inspired by his
              niece in Ceylon during his visit. The poem is included in the
              memoir, and describes his niece's singing with similes. These
              descriptions being a
              <i
                >pig drowning, a crow swimming in milk, and a scorpion being
                pushed through a glass tube</i
              >. The similes are used to prompt the reader to imagine these
              terrible sounds in their head, emphasizing his intent of
              describing a truly terrible voice. The humour of the poem is in
              the irony and sarcasm, as Ondaatje is describing using this style
              of poetry which is usually used to compliment, and using it to
              mock and criticize his niece's singing in a playful tone.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another interesting detail of the poem are the mentions of various
              foods and references to <b>Ceylon / Sri Lanka</b>. The following
              references are included in the poem: The Royal-Thomian, Pappadan,
              Brinjal, Pettah, Betel, Sarong. The common mentions here are used
              to share the thoughts of Michael the when writing the memoir.
              Being able to recognize these aspects of Ceylon's culture, the
              reader gains understanding of Micheal's experience and thoughts in
              Ceylon during the trip. In his perspective, having visited Ceylon,
              being able to remember childhood memories, the food and culture in
              Ceylon. He uses the terms in the poem along with many other terms
              that are more common in western cultures, such as the Bible, and
              jeeps. These references are used to contrast with the references
              to terms more local to Ceylon, with the contrast creating more
              emphasis on the Ceylonese references.

            <h2>"Mervyn: Alcoholism"</h2>
            <p>
              A central topic in the novel is alcohol, being mentioned at least
              once in every section. Ondaatje conveys a theme that alcohol as an
              addiction starts at a young age, and destroys lives. This theme
              and the overall topic of alcoholism is developed in several
              memories and stories in the novel. An especially significant
              example of this is Michael's father, Mervyn, and his issues with
              alcoholism throughout his life. When looking back on earlier
              chapters, it becomes more apparent that his problems with alcohol
              started when he was young. It is brought up numerous times
              throughout the story of Mervyn's younger years, "He invited them
              in, being able to offer them only champagne at eleven in the
              morning." (p. 14). While the first mention of alcohol can be
              dismissed as just a young boy living recklessly off his parents'
              money. The device used here is foreshadowing the start Mervyn's
              troubles with alcohol. The mention here initially seems just as
              brief as the reference of Michael drinking at his farewell party,
              "Once a friend had told me that it was only when I was drunk that
              I seemed to know exactly what I wanted ... in the midst of the
              farewell party in my growing wildness - dancing, balancing a wine
              glass on my forehead ..." (p. 4). A seemingly insignificant
              detail, and with the memoir mainly discussing his family history
              and not Michael himself, this seems to not have the significance
              as alcohol and his father. This significance becomes obvious once
              Mervyn's problem with drinking is mentioned again in the same
              chapter, "There was a pattern of resthouses to be stopped at and
              so Aelian was forced to stop every ten miles and have a drink ...
              by the time they got to Colombo my father was very drunk." (p.
              17). These further mentions re-enforce the certainty of
              foreshadowing, creating suspense and speculation for the reader,
              wondering if alcohol could be the reason Michael describes, "the
              fragments I knew about my father," (p. 5), a distant relationship
              with his father. Michael further explores this topic again in
              later stories about his life with his family, "He drank until he
              collapsed and passed out. Then he would waken and drink again.
              Still no food. Sleep. Get up and have one more shot and then he
              was finished." (pp. 40-41). In this passage, Michael's narration
              describing his fathers alcoholism develops the topic of alcoholism
              further. A literary device used in the passage is hyperbole, which
              in the passage, is used to emphasize the theme that alcohol will
              destroy lives.
