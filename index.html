            <h2>"Jaffna Afternoons: Ondaatje's Storytelling"</h2>
            <p>
              In this chapter, Ondaatje conveys to the reader how the
              storytelling of the book will be expressed. With his writing style
              and way of storytelling being influenced from his family's
              discussions and way of recalling family memories that is not
              necessarily in chronological order.
              <a href="#quote3">
                "No story is ever told just once. Whether a memory of funny
                hideous scandal, we will return to it an hour later and retell
                the story with additions and this time a few judgements thrown
                in." (p. 8).
              </a>
              The writing and discussion throughout the chapter expresses his
              writing style throughout the rest of the story. Telling the
              stories and faint memories in sections, which are not in
              chronological order, only connecting and making sense of the chaos
              by self-referencing the different memories throughout. The
              conversation explains the reasoning behind the writing style,
              deepening the reader understanding of why Ondaatje chose this
              specific style for his family memoir, being that his family often
              recalls memories in the same manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              One aspect of Ondaatje's style of writing and storytelling in the
              book is constant self-references to the memoir itself. There are
              many instances of self-references in this chapter; when Michael is
              describing the house they are in when visiting Ceylon, from
              <a href="#quote1">
                "The walls, painted in recent years a warm rose-red." (p. 6).</a
              >
              And,
              <a href="#quote2"
                >"The doors are twenty feet high, as if awaiting the day when a
                family of acrobats will walk from room to room, sideways ... "
                (p. 6).</a
              >
              Which is referenced later towards the end of the chapter.
              <a href="#quote5"
                >"We are approaching the door being twenty feet high ... The
                whole family walks slowly through the pale pink rose-coloured
                walls into the next room." (p. 9).</a
              >
              The repeated use of self-references in the chapter both
              foreshadows and also reveals to readers the writing style of
              Ondaatje. These references are used to convey the writing and
              storytelling method of which the memoir is based off of, prompting
              the reader to focus on small details, as many references are
              important in later sections of the novel.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, these examples in Jaffna Afternoons only explore the
              self-referencing aspect of Ondaatje's writing in the memoir. The
              other aspect of the references being in non-chronological order is
              explored earlier, in the first chapter. A very early example we
              see of this is when Michael is asked during his farewell party,
              <a href="#quote0"
                >"'So how did your grandmother die?' 'Natural causes.' 'What?'
                'Floods.'" (p. 5).</a
              >
              The reference is about Lalla, who dies during a particularly
              strong monsoon which causes a flood as the reader learns in a
              later section.
              <a href="#quote111"
                >"Below the main street of Nuwara Eliya teh land drops suddenly
                and Lala fell into deeper waters ... there was the great blue
                ahead of her ... she hit it and was dead." (p. 111).</a
              >
              The effect created is a sense of curiosity for the reader when
              first being presented with small details of memories. Then when
              finally being told a larger portion of the story, the reader is
              able to recollect and reflect on the story as a whole after
              linking many of the memories told as a singular entity. The
              storytelling style creating a reading experience that requires
              more focus to recall previous events that were intentionally just
              briefly mentioned, which develops reader understanding of the
              events that occur as later sections of the memoir are revealed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This use of disconnected storytelling of individual stories and
              self-references to connect the memoir can also have flaws. One of
              which, being difficult to follow and requiring very focused
              reading and analysis in order to even understand the events of the
              memoir at a basic level. This style of writing often leads to
              confusing references throughout the novel. Some of these
              references seemingly leading to nowhere, creating many red
              herrings. One particularly example of this in Jaffna Afternoons
              being,
              <a href="#quote4"
                >"I do catch one piece of dialogue. A Mr. Hobday has asked my
                father if he has any Dutch antiques in the house. And he
                replies, 'Well ... there is my mother.'" (p. 9).</a
              >
              A certain Mr. Hobday talking to Michael's father is the one and
              only piece of dialogue he manages to catch. The character can be
              assumed to be important, talking to Michael's father, who is one
              of the central focuses of the memoir. The particular storytelling
              style could be used to reference this moment later in the memoir,
              however, the memoir seems to never mentions Hobday again after
              this chapter. This creates a creates some confusion, as other
              references, just as brief as this one, are very important to the
              story.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jaffna Afternoons encapsulates Ondaatje's writing style, with main
              aspects being self-references to connect together a memoir told as
              individual stories, which are often not in chronological order.
              The chapter uses many references within itself, to deliberately
              show the the storytelling method in a short chapter, making it
              clear how the story will be presented. This storytelling and
              writing style, creating an effect of curiosity and makes the
              reader have to focus on every small detail and brief mention of
              stories. However, the writing style also creates some red herrings
              throughout the story, that lead stories that may be made up, or
              not important enough to be explored in the story. The chapter
              itself, serves as a preface to the story, telling the reader how
              the memoir is structured not by time, but instead by connections
              of references, and tells the reader how they should read the
              memoir.
